## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection:**  
   Gathered skin disease datasets, including symptoms, severity, description, and precautions.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Cleaned and structured data for use in machine learning models.

3. **Model Training:**  
   Developed machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest) to predict skin diseases based on symptoms.

4. **Prediction Interface:**  
   Built a user-friendly Streamlit web app to input symptoms or upload images and get predictions.

5. **Output:**  
   Displays predicted disease with descriptions, symptoms, recommended medicines, and precautions.
